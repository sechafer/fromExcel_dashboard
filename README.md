# Overview

As a software engineer, I developed a web-based dashboard application to solve a real business challenge in data visualization. The project focuses on making data from Salesforce Marketing Cloud accessible and understandable without requiring additional licenses for tools like Power BI.

This application leverages JavaScript to create an interactive dashboard that processes Excel reports and transforms them into meaningful visualizations. The software demonstrates modern JavaScript capabilities in both frontend and backend development, showcasing skills in file processing, data manipulation, and dynamic visualization creation.

The purpose of this software is to provide marketing teams with an efficient way to analyze email campaign performance metrics. It processes Excel files containing marketing data and generates interactive charts and metrics for key performance indicators such as open rates, bounce rates, and engagement metrics.
